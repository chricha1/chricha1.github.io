#### Defenders of Wildlife Internship

In summer of 2018, I worked as the GIS Intern at
the Defenders of Wildlife headquarters in Washington, D.C.

One of my projects involved working on derelict vessel issues in Washington State.
I corresponded with Tammy Robbins, the Natural Resource Specialist of the
Aquatic Resources Division at the Washington State Department of Natural Resources.
I helped identify and map boat disposal locations throughout
Washington state.
