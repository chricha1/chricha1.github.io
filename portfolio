## Defenders of Wildlife Internship
In summer of 2018, I worked as the GIS Intern at the Defenders of Wildlife headquarters in Washington, D.C.

One of my projects involved working on derelict vessel issues in Washington State.
I corresponded with Tammy Robbins, the Natural Resource Specialist of the Aquatic Resources Division at
the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. I helped identify and map boat disposal locations
throughout Washington state.

I also helped the Alaska DoW office to update oil spill report maps. I labeled a map of Kodiak Island
and a map of Cook Inlet.
