#### Process of Creating the Map
For guidelines on how to add visual details to the map, I did a Google search of "Baltimore MVA"
to see what types of colors others have used to make a map like this. I also watched two map production videos on YouTube,
[Cartography with QGIS Task 1] (www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb8EJFV4SLs) and [Cartography with QGIS Task 2] (www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TpCuwGeDZc).
... (more on what I learned from videos) ...

I used the given shapefile called "baltimore_mva_2014" shapefile, which contained the market types in the  the column hmt.
For example: A - Regional Choice, B & C - Middle Market Choice, D - Middle Market, E & F - Middle Market Stressed, G & H - Stressed,
Water, Commercial, Green Space, Non-residential, etc.

... Can you get the Stamen Toner (or other) basemap? (https://www.xyht.com/spatial-itgis/using-openstreetmap-basemaps-qgis-3-0/)

#### Tools Used
I used Open Street Map for the basemap, and a Baltimore City boundary from the City of Baltimore Open GIS Data Site for the drop shadow.
I used QGIS Print Layout to compose the map. 

#### Findings
I found that for the Baltimore Housing Typology, the ideal market was towards the center of downtown and the north.
Surrounding those areas were mostly stressed, and there were some middle market choices on the outskirts.
