title: Final Project Proposal
---

### Objectives
Heatmap, Moran's I, Python, SQL, statistical analysis.

### Question
How does the presence of art organizations affect crime in Baltimore City?

### Data


### Tools
* Heatmap to summarize the density of crimes and create a color gradient for number of art organizations in each neighborhood.
* 3D heatmap.
* SQL to select crimes that occurred in 2014 only, and to narrow them down to homicides and shootings.
* Python to count the number of crimes that occurred in each neighborhood.
* Moran's I to visualize the correlation between presence of art organizations and crime.

### Process
I will know when I have answered my question when I see a significant relationship between urban areas and shrinking bird habitat range.

### Rationale
* Other components that I will incorporate are 3D maps and spatial analysis using Python.
* I chose this component because I want to show the percentage difference in crime between Baltimore City neighborhoods with
art organizations and those without art organizations.
* This project is more involved than the labs because I am doing various types of analysis.

### Conclusions
*
