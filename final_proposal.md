title: Final Project Proposal
---

### Objectives
I am going to visualize how anthropogenic climate change affects habitat ranges of three bird species.
I want to explore the relationship between urban areas and bird habitat, and compare that with rural areas.
Look at current and projected for summer, winter, and permanent ranges.
Three bird species - Bald eagle (pg 22), Greater Sage-grouse (pg 38),  Mississippi Kite (pg 44) - GAP analysis site.

### Question
How does climate change overall and local human activity affect bird habitat ranges in the United States?

### Data

### Tools
I will use Moran's I and hexagonal analysis to summarize my findings and put it on the map.
I will use Python to automate the geoprocessing of mapping habitat range in different years for each bird species.

### Process
I will know when I have answered my question when I see a significant relationship between urban areas and shrinking bird habitat range.

### Rationale
* Other components from the class that I will incorporate are GIFs and color-coding/highlighting areas with each time period change.
* I chose this component because it is the easiest way to see how bird habitat changes over time since the base (blank map of the United
States) remains the same.
* This project is more involved than the labs because

### Conclusions
