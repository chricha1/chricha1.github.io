What are you going to do for the final project?
What is your question?
Where is the data coming from? (Provide links)
What three non-superficial elements from the class are you going to incorporate? Python? SQL? Moran's I? 3D mapping? Hexagonal analysis? Analysis in GeoDa? Something else? (Non-superficial meaning doing more than importing the data with python.)
How will you know when you've answered your question?

What other component from the class will you incorporate?
Why is it more involved than the labs?
Why did you choose this component?

Go above and beyond and try something new - explain what it is that you learned on your own here.
