During the summer of 2018, I worked as a GIS Intern in the Center for Conservation Innovation
at the Defenders of Wildlife headquarters in Washington, D.C.

One of my projects involved working on derelict vessel issues in Washington State.
I corresponded with Tammy Robbins, the Natural Resource Specialist of the Aquatic Resources Division
at the Washington State Department of Natural Resources.
I helped identify and map boat disposal locations throughout Washington state.
