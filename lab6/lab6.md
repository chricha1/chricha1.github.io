#### Part 2

1 . Created a Queen contiguity weight based on the ID variable
"OBJECTID" (instead of "CSA2010" because it is a string) in the
"Vital_Signs_16_Arts_and_Culture" shapefile.

2 . Ran a regression report to observe the correlation between
"cebus16" (Number of Businesses that are Arts-Related
per 1000 Residents) and "libcard16" (Number of Persons with
Library Cards per 1,000 Residents).

I compared the probability of Lagrange Multiplier (lag)
with the probability of Lagrange Multiplier (error). Both were
significant (p < 0.05), but LM (error) was more significant
than LM (lag).

I found that the Moran's I was a positive number so that means
there is a correlation between the number of persons with library cards
and the number of art-related businesses.

3 . Created the Bivariate Local Moran's I map.

The high-high (dark red) Downtown, Mount Vernon, and Charles Village neighborhoods
are bordered by neighborhoods with low numbers that are not significant enough
to cluster and split into low and high numbers when compared with the
rest of Baltimore City.

The low-high (light blue) neighborhoods have low numbers but are bordered by
neighborhoods with high numbers.

#### Part 3

Aggregating arts and culture data (such as arts-related
businesses, employment in arts-related businesses,
and public library membership) is necessary to identify
and promote the health of artists, arts organizations, and,
as a result, communities as a whole.

In creative placemaking, partners from public,
private, non-profit, and community sectors strategically shape
the physical and social character of a neighborhood, town, city,
or region around arts and cultural activities.

Creative placemaking animates public and private spaces,
rejuvenates structures and streetscapes, improves local
business viability and public safety, and brings diverse
people together to celebrate, inspire, and be inspired. Therefore,
creative placemaking impacts the well-being of Baltimore residents.
